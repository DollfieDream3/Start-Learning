### Start Learning ###

I am a current Penn State University math student.
This is my first GitHub repository, all files under this repo are a representation of my learning progress.
Although I have some coding experience, there are still a lot for me to learn.

I have learned some C/C++ and python.
I am interested in learning knowledge related to Machine-Learning, Deep-Learning and Artificial Intelligence.

If you are interested to communicate with me, want to learn coding together, email contact is available.
